  <h1>Original Contributions</h1>

  <p class="s1">Our starting dataset consists of data from over 600 thousand tracks and 1.1 million artists, pulled straight from Spotify, an online music streaming platform. Our initial draw to using this data was the potential of using it to carry out an idea we had: that someone could find specific music, or information about music, with just a few simple search conditions. We as a group find this specific category of data interesting because we are all big fans of music and are all Spotify users. We decided to run with it and create a web-based application in which we use the data to do just this. Essentially, the only thing being “changed” about the dataset is the way in which it is presented, but perhaps this is a monumental way to make sense of what otherwise seems like just a sea of numbers.</p>

  <h2>Broader Impact</h2>

 <ol class = "o1">
  <li><strong>Discovering new tunes.</strong> Users are easily able to query tracks that match their exact specifications, whether they are looking for more tracks by a particular artist, tracks in a specific genre, or even tracks that have very specific qualities such as ‘danceability’ or ‘acousticness’. This gives users the ability to explore and find new music within genres that they love to listen to, in addition to potentially expanding their insights as to what genres they like. For example, a user who likes Pop music could search songs that have a high ‘danceability’ score and discover that they also like Electronic music. </li> </br>
  <li><strong>Finding information about the artists they love.</strong> If a user is ever curious about random information about the music they’re listening to, our application can tell them almost anything they would want to know. Whether they want to know how popular the songs of their favorite artist are, the loudness of the music they’re listening to, or really anything in between they can consult our application. This has a slew of advantages, depending on what a user is looking for in their music. For example, if someone has sensitive ears, they may choose to use our application to find songs with a lower loudness level so that they can protect their hearing. </li></br>
  <li><strong>Compiling lists of tracks or artists for future use.</strong> Whenever a user would like to compile a group of tracks or artists based on any specific condition, our system is capable of allowing them to do so. People can organize tracks or artists based on general sound, specific genre, amount of lyrics, you name it. This is helpful if a user wants to create a playlist that aligns with specifics. For example, if someone wanted to make a summer playlist of pop songs that are high energy and danceable, they can certainly query songs that would fit those exact specifications.</li>
</ol>

<h3>System Architecture</h3>

  <p class="s1">Below, you can find a diagram that outlines the general architecture of the system we have in place. Through our web based application, the user can see the ‘view’ portion of the system which is essentially the front end UI component, composed of HTML/FTLH scripts. As the user wants, they can interact with the interface by using the ‘controller’ portion of the system. The ‘controller’, made up of our driving Java files and Springboot capabilities, takes commands placed on the system by the user and manipulates the ‘model’ portion of the system to retrieve what data the user requests. The ‘model’ is made up of several Java files that handle data and, of course, an SQL framework in which our data is organized. The ‘model’, upon retrieving data, updates the ‘view’ portion of the system and the user sees what they requested. </p>
